Wirecloud-markdown-github
=========================

This python package recopiles some markdown extensions to make 
[Python Markdown](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/) behave more like GFM markdown.
This package not intent to build a full compatible parser of the GFM and its
used mainly in the generation of the WireCloud's documentation as a temporal
work around, our plan is to work for using the official code.

Summary:

- headerid: Modified from the headerid extension provided by the official [Python Markdown](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/)
- superfences: Borrowed from [PyMdown Extensions](https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions)
- magiclink: Borrowed from [PyMdown Extensions](https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions)
